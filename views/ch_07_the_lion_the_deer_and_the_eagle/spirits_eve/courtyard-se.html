A loud shriek was heard through the halls of the monastery. Gavrel ran away from the scene to avoid his grandmother&#39;s incoming wrath. <em>I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever heard her scream before... ever</em> he thought, giggling like an idiot over his prank. He&#39;d lose her in the hedges for a bit. He lifted the red ogre mask to look around. It was more quiet here than the ballroom but there were a few students walking around, each with unique masks. 

Gavrel sat down to catch his breath between chuckles. </div>

It was high time for a break before he spent the rest of his evening playing the night away. 

He stepped out for some air, the optimist <em>beyond</em> excited for this night. That&#39;s when he heard the rustling of bushes. 

&quot;Eek-&quot;

The coward had his own quiet fear when seeing that red colored mask. He swallowed hard.

&quot;That is- quite the mask you have-&quot; </div>

&quot;Aha! You needn&#39;t worry, I am terrified of most things, but I can still appreciate the detail work.&quot;
 
And just like that, his optimism had returned.

&quot;Thank you! I took quite a bit of saving for it.&quot; He played with a feather for a moment. &quot;I assumed it would be fun to be like a songbird for an evening. Is there any reason you chose that one?&quot; </div>

&quot;Oh um th-thank you!&quot; He smiled, the other boy looked more relaxed too.

He nodded to the story and looked at the bird mask. &quot;Oh I can see... Good work paid off! It&#39;s very lovely&quot; indeed it made sense, with the instrument on his possession and all.

He twiddled with the mask sitting on his crown. &quot;Well yeah! Um you see the masks and decorations are to ward evil... Old stories say the masks were made much like gargoyles. Like good monsters who frighten the bad monsters&quot; he remembered the drawing he took inspiration from. &quot;I-I saw this cool picture in the library of one of those old masks and I wanted to look like it&quot; </div>

The handsome bard couldn&#39;t help but keep his wide smile towards the his fellow church member. The fact that they were both getting so comfortable with this little conversation made the rather socially problematic male more excited to speak with the other.

&quot;I enjoy the idea of this tale! I wish for more good monsters to exist, then. But, this will do for now.

Then there was a pause as something clicked in Olvaerr&#39;s mind. In one swift movement, he removed his lute from his back and placed it on his lap, sliding to sit beside Gavrel. 

&quot;Wait- did you <em>make</em> this mask?&quot; 

His pastel blue eyes shimmered in excitement like some sort of stars in a summer sky. </div>

Gavrel saw his fellow member&#39;s eyes glitter as he asked. &quot;Ah uh... Well with a lot of help but yes&quot; his reply was bashful and his cheeks started looking more like the mask. &quot;It&#39;s kind of fragile, nothing like yours. It&#39;s so well crafted!&quot;

You have such excellent bone structure- as if crafted finely by the Goddess herself!&quot; 

The bard has no issue letting out such a compliment, speaking too quickly to let any words in after it. 

&quot;All of my creative abilities are exclusively for music, but how I wish I could make something so wonderful. I am certain it comes with practice but I simply cannot be drawn away from it- except in this moment. I <em>was</em> int he dance hall. I had been there all afternoon setting up as staff and planning with the other minstrels! But, I needed some air before I played the rest of the eve away.&quot;

&quot;I, er....

He chuckled lightly. 

“That sounds lovely! You wouldn’t be keeping me at all though- I enjoy speaking with you already.

The bard gave a playful bow. Before granting a soft smile towards the blue haired male. Callused musician hands would gently wrap around the one offered to him, giving a nod and a thank you after. 

“Oh your hands are very soft.” He stated without thought. “A few months, give or take. It has been quite the riveting experience for me! And, what of you?” </div>

He complimented him again and his face went back to matching the mask. &quot;I- er.... Thank you?&quot; Not something he had given much thought about.  He nodded at the thanks.

 &quot;Oh, that explains why we haven&#39;t really spoken to each other...&quot; he thought out loud. He then turned at Olvaerr &quot;Actually I was born here, since my Grandma moved here from Adrestia we&#39;ve lived in the monastery&quot; he smiled. &quot;What brought you here?&quot; Gavrel asked.

&quot;Being a musician you must&#39;ve seen many interesting sights!&quot; His eyes glittered with excitement. &quot;Did you travel much?&quot; </div>

                    <div class="markdown">The bard was already enjoying their conversation thoroughly. Their little walk through the courtyard would be comfortable. He was sure of it. Though, he was most definitely eager to continue playing with the other minstrels. 

&quot;Born and raised! How interesting! I am certain she has many amazing stories. And, I would love to hear any you have as well sometime.&quot;

Bringing his lute to his hands again, he&#39;d begin to play some nice, calming background music for their little walk.

&quot;Unfortunately, I have not. I have never really left my home town- we could hardly afford to get myself this lute. But, once I had it I tried to make and save money to attend Garreg Mach as a student! I wished to meet heroes, leaders, all the sort so I could write songs about them! Perhaps even travel and learn to protect myself while doing so.&quot;

Olvaerr spoke eagerly, but quickly deflated. He still kept a positive face.

&quot;Unfortunately it was never enough. My father is wonderful and kind, and picked up being a knight once again so that I could come here. I also picked up a job to aid in any extra finances. It is not much of a story, but my little town had many people at the bar willing to share their tales! I have written plenty about them, if you ever wish to hear.&quot; </div>

Perhaps he took them for granted. &quot;Oh I&#39;ve not much to tell&quot; he chuckled.

It was a bit sad he didn&#39;t have much opportunity to travel either. He had the misconception that non monastic commonfolk had more freedoms, but many times those freedoms required a certain lifestyle. &quot;A student?&quot; 

Gavrel kept quiet for a bit and then he said &quot;Your father must be very proud you! The lengths you two have worked so hard to make your dream real are very impressive&quot;  he smiled. &quot;Your hard work will pay off Olvaerr&quot; he said softly. &quot;Just being here I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already made friends that are worthy of great songs!

He nodded at Olvaerr&#39;s words. &quot;Yes, family is important....&quot; His eyes went wide at the last part. &quot;Oh er... I don&#39;t know about that, but I would be honored Olvaerr!&quot; 

He looked at the entrance. It seemed very lively in there! Perhaps even some awkard sliding around would be fun.

But speaking of family.... A loud, elderly yell in the distance caught the monk&#39;s attention.

<em>GAVREL MEIER!</em> 

&quot;Olvaerr, you&#39;ve been grand but I have to go. I&#39;ll come see you perform when I lose Nanna again in the courtyard&quot; and like that Gavrel sprinted back into the bushes. </div>

“Are you also hiding out here, Your Highness?”

Rowan didn&#39;t really want space she was out here waiting to meet someone out here. For now, she paces around to keep herself warm, rubbing at her mask so the metal doesn&#39;t freeze her face or anything like that. Ughhhhhh they&#39;re late! A small groan escapes the other, of course they had to choose outside where it was chilly and dark and no one would be around because <em>secrets are just so important.</em>

Deciding in the end, she plops down on a bench and starts folding down the sleeves of her shirt to be a bit warmer then closes her eyes with a small hum.

                    <div class="markdown">Disentangling himself from all the social hubbub and slipping away unseen proved to be far more difficult than he had anticipated. Every time he thought he was safe, someone else would run into him and insist on a conversation - or, even worse, a dance. Outright denying both was his worst option, and giving the excuse of getting some fresh air would only prompt them to follow. So, each time, he partook in some dull chitchat and pretended to see someone else asking for his attention.

Finally, <em>finally</em> he made it out to the courtyard, half-stumbling toward the pacing Rowan. He weaves around to approach from the front, a habit formed quickly after the first time he spooked her.

&quot;Hey there, Ro,&quot; he greets, taking note of the way his breath turns to mist in the crisp air. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late; everyone and their mother wanted to dance with me.&quot; </div>

“Of course everyone wants to be around you? Have you looked in the mirror? And your personality is fun to boot!”

Patting the spot beside her on the bench, Rowan sighed and nodded slightly in understanding. 

“That’s alright. I understand it’s tiring being someone important….not to mention I had so many classmates coming to me to learn how to dance as fast as possible. Half of them were for you, anyhow.”

Laughing to herself, Rowan leaned on her friend as he sat beside her. 

“So…..who’s sharing their findings first?” </div>

Then he flops down onto the bench, slouched backwards as he rests his intertwined fingers over his stomach, and lets out a big sigh.

&quot;The biggest finding I came across was that Acheron is making all sorts of noncommittal moves - groveling to Gloucester, then turning around and making big claims about Myrddin.&quot;

He pauses the look right at her with a very serious expression. &quot;The next was that three staff members basically came wearing the same outfit and masks. Can you believe it?&quot; </div>

She had wanted to go back to her room, but instead she made an attempt to go back in, but she couldn&#39;t help herself but to continue on in. Instead she found herself sitting at one of the empty tables, one ofa few that didn&#39;t have any games placed on them. She was building up a courage to go in, but at this rate she would probably just be sitting there until the end of the day. </div>

Not a muscle moved as she contemplated the several over the top scenarios that could occur throughout the night to her. Probably the least harmful moment that could happen to her that she thought about was being pulled onto the dance floor with all eyes on her at that moment. She would crumble, standing there thoughtless in front of a crowd watching her. 

All those thoughts were interrupted by a greeting, Lucy turned to the voice immediately, recoiling her arms away to prevent being grabbed. &quot;No!&quot; A sigh of relief after a moment, realising it was just Selena. &quot;O-Oh. Selena, hello. I do not like the crowd, so it is hard to socialize. I am not used to it.&quot; 
She could have just lied about it, but no, she thought that woud make the situation worse for her and maybe cause Selena to even take her back inside.

&quot;Please do not tell anyone I am here.&quot; </div>

<em>Well, the only reason Selena can stay inside is because she&#39;s somewhat used to such an environment, and has something to hyperfixate on.  ...Let&#39;s just ignore that No and respond to the rest...</em>

Should she really be honest about it why she is here? No, of course she cannot, but she can be vague about it, which is the most honest she can be. Selena seems trusting enough about this information.
&quot;I am here because I know that one of my friends would want me to atleast try to join in.&quot; She even got the mask for the occassion, she is not wearing it right now since it is laying infront of her on the desk.

&quot;Your duty is to protect Thyra, correct? Do you not think she is capable to protect herself when the moment is needed? You were unconsious for quite a while after our spar, do you think that with you out of the way that she was in more danger than before that?&quot; This was not the way she expected this conversation to go, but it felt similar to how Terra acted with her. </div>
